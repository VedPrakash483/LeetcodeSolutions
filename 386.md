# 🧮 Lexicographical Order of Numbers

**Date:** September 21, 2024

## 📝 Problem Description
Given an integer `n`, return all numbers in the range `[1, n]` sorted in **lexicographical order**. The solution should run in `O(n)` time and use `O(1)` extra space (apart from the result storage). This means we are tasked with finding an efficient way to list the numbers in the same order as a dictionary or a phone book would sort them.

### Example:
**Input:** `n = 13`  
**Output:** `[1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

## 💡 Approach
The task is to generate numbers in lexicographical order efficiently without sorting them after generating. Instead, we can simulate this order using a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** approach.

### 🔍 Key Insights:
- Lexicographical order means we explore numbers starting with `1`, followed by `10, 11, 12, ..., 19`, then `2`, and so on.
- We need to recursively explore all possible numbers starting from digits `1-9` and then append digits (`0-9`) to generate the next lexicographical number.

### 🚀 Steps:
1. **DFS-like Traversal:** Start from `1`, add it to the result, then try to generate numbers `10`, `11`, ..., up to the next lexicographical number.
2. **Recursive Exploration:** After exploring all numbers with prefix `1`, move to `2`, then `3`, and so on, while making sure we do not exceed `n`.
3. **Efficiency:** The algorithm runs in `O(n)` because we visit each number only once.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function for DFS-like lexicographical traversal
    void lexi(int i, int n, vector<int> &ans) {
        if (i > n) {
            return;  // Stop when the number exceeds 'n'
        }
        ans.push_back(i);  // Add the current number to the result
        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            lexi(i * 10 + j, n, ans);  // Recursively explore numbers like i0, i1, ..., i9
        }
    }

    vector<int> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        vector<int> ans;  // Result vector to store numbers in lexicographical order
        
        // Start DFS from numbers 1 to 9
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            lexi(i, n, ans);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
