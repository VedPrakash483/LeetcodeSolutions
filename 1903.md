# Finding the Largest Odd Number Substring

⭐ **Date:** September 20, 2024

## Problem Description
You are given a string `num`, representing a large integer. The task is to return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a non-empty substring of `num`, or an empty string `""` if no odd integer exists. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

## Approach
I iterated through the input string from right to left. At each position, I checked if the digit at that position is odd. If an odd digit was found, I returned the substring up to that position. If no odd digit was found, I returned an empty string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string largestOddNumber(string num) {
        int n = num.length();
        for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if((num[i] - '0') % 2 != 0) {
                return num.substr(0, i + 1);
            }
        }

        return "";
    }
};
