## 🚀 Sum of Digits of String After Convert 🚀

Today's challenge involved transforming a string of lowercase letters into a numerical sequence and applying a series of digit transformations. Here's how I tackled it! 🔢💻❥

### 🔍 Approach Explanation:

1️⃣ **String Conversion**:  
   I converted each character in the string to its corresponding position in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' to 1, 'b' to 2, ..., 'z' to 26). This created a large integer representing the entire string.

2️⃣ **Digit Summation**:  
   The next step involved calculating the sum of the digits of this integer. This step was repeated to achieve the required transformation.

3️⃣ **Iterative Transformation**:  
   Finally, I applied the transformation operation a total of **k** times to arrive at the final result.

---

🚀 By structuring the problem into clear, manageable steps, I was able to efficiently solve it and transform the string as required. This approach highlights the importance of breaking down complex tasks into simpler components for better understanding and implementation. 🌟💡

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getLucky(string s, int k) {
        string digits = getnum(s);
        int result = 0;
        for (char c : digits) {
            result += c - '0';
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            result = kloop(result);
        }

        return result;
    }

    string getnum(string str) {
        string digits = "";
        for (char c : str) {
            int num = c - 'a' + 1;
            digits += to_string(num);
        }
        return digits;
    }

    int kloop(int number) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (number != 0) {
            sum += number % 10;
            number /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
