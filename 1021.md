## 🚀 Removing Outermost Parentheses 🚀

Today's challenge involved removing the outermost parentheses from a given string containing parentheses. Here's how I approached and solved it! 💡💻❥

### 🔍 Approach Explanation:

1️⃣ **Balanced Parentheses Check**:  
   I maintained a balance of parentheses while iterating through the input string. By keeping track of the balance, I identified and excluded the outermost parentheses.

2️⃣ **Building the Result String**:  
   During the iteration, I selectively added characters to the result string based on the balance of parentheses, excluding the outermost ones.

3️⃣ **Returning the Result**:  
   Finally, I returned the resulting string with the outermost parentheses removed.

---

🚀 By carefully managing the balance of parentheses and selectively constructing the result string, I successfully solved the problem of removing outermost parentheses. This approach demonstrates the importance of tracking state in solving string manipulation tasks effectively. 🌟💡

        int n = s.length();

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(s[i] == '(') {
                if(balance > 0) {
                    result += s[i];
                }
                balance++;
            } else {
                balance--;
                if(balance > 0) {
                    result += s[i];

        return result;
    }
