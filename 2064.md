# 🌟 Problem of the Day: September 6, 2024 🌟

Today's challenge focused on distributing products among retail stores in such a way that the maximum number of products given to any store is minimized. Here's a breakdown of how I approached it! 🏬🛒

## 🔍 Problem:
Given n retail stores and an array quantities representing the amount of each product type, the task is to distribute the products to the stores such that no store receives more than one type of product. The goal is to minimize the maximum number of products given to any single store.

## 💡 Key Example:
Input: n = 6, quantities = [11, 6]
Output: 3
We distribute the 11 products of type 0 to four stores as: [2, 3, 3, 3]
The 6 products of type 1 are distributed to two stores as: [3, 3] Thus, the maximum number of products given to any store is 3.

## 🔧 Approach:
1️⃣ Binary Search:
We used binary search to determine the minimum possible value of x, which represents the maximum number of products that any store receives.
2️⃣ Greedy Distribution:
For each midpoint mid in our binary search range, we calculated how many stores would be required to handle the products, using the formula (q + mid - 1) / mid to simulate distributing q products to the stores.
3️⃣ Optimization Check:
We checked whether the number of required stores exceeds n. If so, we increase mid (meaning the number of products per store is too small), otherwise, we decrease it to minimize x.

## 🚀 Final Insight:
By combining binary search and efficient distribution of products, we found an optimal way to minimize the maximum number of products that any store receives! This approach allowed us to balance the load between stores efficiently and quickly. 🌟

        int maxi=0;
        for(int q : quantities){
            if(maxi < q){
                maxi=q;
            }
        }
        int left = 1, right = maxi;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int stores = 0;
            
            for (int q : quantities) {
                stores += (q + mid - 1) / mid; //ceil((double)q / mid);
            }
            
            if (stores > n) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
};
